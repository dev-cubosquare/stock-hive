            <p>THESE TERMS OF SERVICE (“TERMS”) GOVERN YOUR ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE STOCKHIVE APPLICATION (“APP”).
                PLEASE READ THESE TERMS CAREFULLY AND CONTACT US IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. BY ACCESSING OR USING THE
                APP, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND OUR PRIVACY POLICY.<br><br>
                StockHive Intraday is made available to you by StockHive, a product of Hive Technologies Inc. These
                terms constitute a legal agreement between you (“you”) and StockHive (“we”, “our”, “us”).<br><br>
                No Financial Advice<br>
                StockHive is not engaged in the business of investment advice, merchant banking, investment banking or
                any brokerage service. The information, insights and portfolios available on the App are outputs of
                mathematical models generated by our AI and are drawn and made available from publicly available
                historical data, including financial data. Any advice contained on the App is general advice only and we
                do not tell you whether any investment is suited to your personal circumstances, objectives, risk
                appetite or financial situation. Before making any investment decision, you should consider whether it
                is appropriate for your situation and seek professional advice. Past performance is no guarantee of
                future returns.<br><br>
                Intraday Trading<br>
                Intraday trading is high risk in nature, and you are responsible for ensuring you are familiar with the
                risks involved, including the use of margin / leverage. StockHive provides general guidance on the
                intraday portfolio functionality throughout the App, including definitions, but it is solely your
                responsibility to define appropriate investment amounts and the level of risk you are comfortable
                taking. StockHive is responsible for passing your instructions to your brokerage account for execution.
                All execution activities happen through your brokerage account.<br><br>
                Order Management<br>
                By using the StockHive Intraday service you are responsible for the setting of relevant stop losses. In
                addition to the initial purchase or sell order, stop loss orders will also be passed to your brokerage
                account by StockHive. StockHive provides suggestions of appropriate stop loss limits based on the output
                of our AI models, however you are free to configure these to meet your needs. Once you have confirmed
                the relevant limits StockHive will pass these instructions to your brokerage account.
                All orders will be placed as market orders for the purposes of execution, which may see some deviation
                from the proposed price shown at the time of execution.<br><br>
