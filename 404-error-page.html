            <p>
                Whoops! Looks like this page has buzzed off somewhere else in the hive! 🚀 Our tech-bees are on the
                case, working their wings off to get things back on track. 🛠️ Until then, why not take a detour back to
                the honeycomb, uh, we mean, the home page? 🏠 Don't worry, we won't sting! 🐝 Remember, in the hive,
                every error is just another reason to keep buzzing! 😬
